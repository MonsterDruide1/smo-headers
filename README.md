# smo-headers
This is a collection of all (or most) public header files for the game Super Mario Odyssey. These were collected in a community effort to help with modding the game.

## How to use
This repository can simply be included in your project using for example `git submodule`. I suggest placing this in a separate directory next to the custom header files, for example using `include/...` for custom files and `lib/...` as the location for this repo.

To add the repository as a submodule named `lib` to the current folder, run this command:
```git
git submodule add https://github.com/MonsterDruide1/smo-headers lib
```

Make sure to add `lib` and `lib/sead` to your includes, either by using the `-Ilib -Ilib/sead` compiler flags or by adding it to a makefile.

An example project using this repository as base for headers is the [practice mod](https://github.com/MonsterDruide1/smo-practice).

## Versions
As multiple different versions of the headers got created and evolved differently, this repository tries to get them back together in a single, accessible location. However, at the moment not all of the headers are properly polished up and merged to a single location, so different bases can be selected to use in the project.

Please note that the Header collection by RicBent is in "unfixable state" for the most part. It has probably been autogenerated from symbols in the game, and thus is lacking all return types. The project will be included for completeness sake here, but will not be further dealt with or fixed.

To use a specific version of the headers, adjust your includes accordingly: For example, to use the headers of `SuperMarioOdysseyOnline`, pick `lib/online-headers` and `lib/online-headers/sead` as your includes instead.
